Digital bibliography of library & information science
=====================================================

I intend to use this repository to collect several scripts that aggregate
bibliographic data related to library and information science. There should
be something like DBLP for this profession. Some data can be collected
automatically but sure there is always some manual work in cataloging.

Contents
--------

* scripts -- various scripts 
* data -- output directory

The data directory contains one subdirectory for each data source. If
there is a script of same name, the subdirectory is fully created and
filled by the script. Other data subdirectories are created manually.
